Effects of low frequency electric fields on synaptic integration in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons: implications for power line emissions
Cavarretta F, Carnevale NT, Tegolo D, Migliore M
Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience (2014)

The model shows the effects induced by an electric field at power
lines frequency.  The simulation file "init.hoc" will run a typical
simulation, with or without an electric field of 40V/m at 50Hz.

 -- Simulation --
After NEURON is installed and your browser configured auto-launch from
ModelDB or

 Under Unix system:
 to compile the mod files use the command

  nrnivmodl

 and open the simulation file using the command

  nrngui init.hoc


 Under Window system:
 to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.  A double click
 on "init.hoc" will open the simulation window.

Once the simulation is started:
Click on the "Run sims" button to run the simulation.  After a minute
the figure you see being created should look like:
